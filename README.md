# Keydell-Richard-Term-Project-

Keydell Fuller and Rich Speiss


# The Big Idea:

Our project is focused on using API, JSON, flask, natural language processing, and website interface design technologies to develop a website that provides investors with a real-time stock rating based on a variety of data sources when it is provided with a ticker symbol. These sources would include recent news articles mentioning the company and the yahoo finance page for the stock. Our program will cross reference its own natural language processing sentiment analysis on the news articles with the yahoo finance stock data to produce its stock rating output of either buy, hold, or sell.

Our website will allow busy individuals seeking to enter the investment market a way to start investing without paying exorbitant subscription fees or spending time reviewing individual sites. By leveraging the power of data and advanced technologies, we believe that our project has the potential to bring a new generation of investors to the market.

# Learning Objectives:

Our learning objectives are listed below. However, we are not going to limit ourselves to just the following list. These are goals in terms of what we want to learn about but we most certainly hope to learn much more during this term project.

-   Learn what it takes to create a useful piece of code 

-   Learn about what an attainable goal is in regard to software development

-   Learn the process of an official coding project from ideation to production

-   Learn coding project management skills

-   Learn how to create an API

-   Coding Creativity and coding problem-solving

# Implementation Plan

1.  After receiving the response from this proposal, solidify the scope and requirements of the project, including the types of data sources to be used, the features of the user interface, and the desired output format for the stock rating.

2.  Identify and select the necessary APIs and data sources to gather the required information for the project.

3.  Develop a natural language processing algorithm to analyze recent news articles related to a given company and determine the overall sentiment expressed in those articles.

4.  Develop a parser to gather stock data from the Yahoo Finance API, including real-time stock prices, historical prices, and other relevant financial ratios.

5.  Develop a software function that utilizes data from Yahoo to compute the implied value of the given stock

6.  Develop a software function that gathers the stock rating provided by yahoo finance. 

7.  Develop a code that cross-references the importance-weighted inputs (implied stock value, the yahoo stock rating, and the sentiment analysis results) to determine the recommended stock position of buy, hold or sell. 

8.  Use flask to design a user interface for both the input and output of the program

9.  Test the website and the algorithms with a range of different stocks and news articles to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results.

10. Incorporate user feedback to refine the website interface and optimize the algorithms for improved performance and usability.

11. Launch the website and begin promoting it to potential users through targeted marketing campaigns, partnerships with financial institutions, and other relevant channels.

12. Get an A

# Collaboration Plan:

## Communication

-   Platforms 

-   Slack for immediate communication 

-   Github for code pushes and updating 

-   G-Drive for files and documentation 

-   Google calendar and Google meets for meetings and scheduling 

-   Meetings twice a week to sync 

-   Task and project area division to optimize time management 

-   Weekly integration of divided portions to test integration ability

## Ensuring collaboration 

-   We agree as a team to respond to slack communications daily if not more multiple times per day.

-   We agree to ensure we manage our other responsibility effectively so that they do not encroach on the success of this project

-   We agree to attend class so that we can have an in-person check-in twice a week in addition to our meetings

## Reasoning 

-   Keydell lives off campus so it makes the most sense to work separately and collaborate via Webex twice a week.

-   We are both confident in our ability to problem solve and debug independently with the help of chatGPT and other online resources.

# Risks and Limitations: 

Below we have listed some of the expectations of this project. We plan to follow these points as a guideline to ensure that we remain focused on the project. At any point during the project, we can refer to this list to either recheck ourselves or remind each other of the expectations.

-   Minimum achievement of the MVP 

-   Setting some reach goals up 

-   Staying consistent 

-   Dedicating time and effort

-   Lack of communication and slow response time

-   Procrastination and a load of other classes

-   The time crunch of completing the project in less than four weeks.

# Additional Course Content: 

There have been lessons during this semester that will lend a hand to our target term project. The lessons around text analysis and APIs will be the most useful to us. Our project will lean heavily on API access for information gathering. The project will then need text analysis to interpret the data that has been collected. Below we have listed a few of the sessions that will potentially be helpful.
